Article: Prompt caching

Prompt caching allows you to reduce overall request latency and cost for longer prompts that have identical content at the beginning of the prompt. "Prompt" in this context is referring to the input you send to the model as part of your chat completions request. Rather than reprocess the same input tokens over and over again, the service is able to retain a temporary cache of processed input token computations to improve overall performance. Prompt caching has no impact on the output content returned in the model response beyond a reduction in latency and cost. For supported models, cached tokens are billed at a discount on input token pricing for Standard deployment types and up to 100% discount on input tokens for Provisioned deployment types.
Caches are typically cleared within 5-10 minutes of inactivity and are always removed within one hour of the cache's last use. Prompt caches are not shared between Azure subscriptions.
