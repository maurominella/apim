Article: How to configure content filters

The content filtering system integrated into Azure AI Foundry runs alongside the core models, including DALL-E image generation models. It uses an ensemble of multi-class classification models to detect four categories of harmful content (violence, hate, sexual, and self-harm) at four severity levels respectively (safe, low, medium, and high), and optional binary classifiers for detecting jailbreak risk, existing text, and code in public repositories.

The default content filtering configuration is set to filter at the medium severity threshold for all four content harms categories for both prompts and completions. That means that content that is detected at severity level medium or high is filtered, while content detected at severity level low or safe is not filtered by the content filters. Learn more about content categories, severity levels, and the behavior of the content filtering system here.

Jailbreak risk detection and protected text and code models are optional and on by default. For jailbreak and protected material text and code models, the configurability feature allows all customers to turn the models on and off. The models are by default on and can be turned off per your scenario. Some models are required to be on for certain scenarios to retain coverage under the Customer Copyright Commitment.
